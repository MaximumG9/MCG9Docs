# Tick
A tick is the smallest period of time in minecraft.
Usually ticks are supposed to take up 1/20th of a second,
but by using lag or the /tick command they can take more or less time.
Since ticks are the base unit of time they are commonly used to measure time in game.
When a second is used to refer to a period of time in game, it usually means 20 ticks, unless specified as real time.

Tick or ticking also can refer to specific objects that update every tick, like an entity's tick, or a ticking block entity.
Ticks are done both on the client and server. [Server Tick](ServerTick.md), [Client Tick](ClientTick.md)
